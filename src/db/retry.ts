/**
 * One retry, for connection failures only.
 *
 * The database sits in `us-east-2` and the operators are in India, so a dropped
 * socket is a normal event rather than a bug — and a single dropped socket used
 * to render a 500 on whatever page happened to be loading. When the connection
 * died, the query provably never ran, so retrying it is safe.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow:
 *   - ONE retry, not a loop. If the second attempt fails, the operator sees the
 *     error page and can retry themselves.
 *   - Connection-class failures ONLY. `57014` (statement timeout) means the
 *     query DID run, so retrying could do the work twice.
 *   - Reads only. `provisionMembership` inserts a member row and an audit row
 *     with no unique guard, so a blind retry there would double-provision.
